title: "Transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies identify genes associated with renal cell carcinoma"
abstract: "We performed a series of integrative analyses including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) and proteome-wide association studies (PWASs) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to nominate and prioritize molecular targets for laboratory investigation. On the basis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 29,020 affected individuals and 835,670 control individuals and prediction models trained in transcriptomic reference models, our TWAS across four kidney transcriptomes (GTEx kidney cortex, kidney tubules, TCGA-KIRC [The Cancer Genome Atlas kidney renal clear-cell carcinoma], and TCGA-KIRP [TCGA kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma]) identified 38 gene associations (false-discovery rate <5%) in at least two of four transcriptomic panels and identified 12 genes that were independent of GWAS susceptibility regions. Analyses combining TWAS associations across 48 tissues from GTEx identified associations that were replicable in tumor transcriptomes for 23 additional genes. Analyses by the two major histologic types (clear-cell RCC and papillary RCC) revealed subtype-specific associations, although at least three gene associations were common to both subtypes. PWAS identified 13 associated proteins, all mapping to GWAS-significant loci. TWAS-identified genes were enriched for active enhancer or promoter regions in RCC tumors and hypoxia-inducible factor binding sites in relevant cell lines. Using gene expression correlation, common cancers (breast and prostate) and RCC risk factors (e.g., hypertension and BMI) display genetic contributions shared with RCC. Our work identifies potential molecular targets for RCC susceptibility for downstream functional investigation."
