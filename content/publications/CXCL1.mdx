title: "Cell-Autonomous Cxcl1 Sustains Tolerogenic Circuitries and Stromal Inflammation via Neutrophil-Derived TNF in Pancreatic Cancer"
abstract: "TWe have shown that KRAS–TP53 genomic coalteration is associated with immune-excluded microenvironments, chemoresistance, and poor survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. By treating KRAS–TP53 cooperativity as a model for high-risk biology, we now identify cell-autonomous Cxcl1 as a key mediator of spatial T-cell restriction via interactions with CXCR2 neutrophilic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in human PDAC using imaging mass cytometry. Silencing of cell-intrinsic Cxcl1 in LSL-Kras;Trp53;Pdx-1(KPC) cells reprograms the trafficking and functional dynamics of neutrophils to overcome T-cell exclusion and controls tumor growth in a T cell–dependent manner. Mechanistically, neutrophil-derived TNF is a central regulator of this immunologic rewiring, instigating feed-forward Cxcl1 overproduction from tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), T-cell dysfunction, and inflammatory CAF polarization via transmembrane TNF–TNFR2 interactions. TNFR2 inhibition disrupts this circuitry and improves sensitivity to chemotherapy in vivo. Our results uncover cancer cell–neutrophil cross-talk in which context-dependent TNF signaling amplifies stromal inflammation and immune tolerance to promote therapeutic resistance in PDAC."
