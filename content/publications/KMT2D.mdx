title: "Methylation of the chromatin modifier KMT2D by SMYD2 contributes to therapeutic response in hormone-dependent breast cancer"
abstract: "Activating mutations in PIK3CA are frequently found in estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, and the combination of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor alpelisib with anti-ER inhibitors is approved for therapy. We have previously demonstrated that the PI3K pathway regulates ER activity through phosphorylation of the chromatin modifier KMT2D. Here, we discovered a methylation site on KMT2D, at K1330 directly adjacent to S1331, catalyzed by the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2. SMYD2 loss attenuates alpelisib-induced KMT2D chromatin binding and alpelisib-mediated changes in gene expression, including ER-dependent transcription. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of SMYD2 sensitizes breast cancer cells, patient-derived organoids, and tumors to PI3K/AKT inhibition and endocrine therapy in part through KMT2D K1330 methylation. Together, our findings uncover a regulatory crosstalk between post-translational modifications that fine-tunes KMT2D function at the chromatin. This provides a rationale for the use of SMYD2 inhibitors in combination with PI3KÎ±/AKT inhibitors in the treatment of ER+/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer."
